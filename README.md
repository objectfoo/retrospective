# Design-kinda

Title at top of page, no need to make it huge. meta section on same line as title with current date.

3 sections follow:

Each section begins with the section title then an input field to enter a new item into the section.

Type into the entry field, save on enter key in field. Optionally save on blur, make save on blur a setting.

When an item is saved it will be added to the beginning of the appropriate list.

Following the first 2 sections; what went well and what needs improvement there is a sub section containing buttons to sort next by vote.
